# Reference Architecture:Â Cross Account AWS CodePipeline

This reference architecture demonstrates how to push code hosted in [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) repository in Development Account,
use [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) to do application build, store the output artifacts in S3Bucket and deploy these artifacts to a Test AWS account, validate your deployment then approve the changes to be deployed to the Production Account using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). This orchestration of code movement from code checkin to deployment is securely handled by [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/).

## Running the example
> You need to create the CodeCommit repository (steps below) before making the pipeline infrastructure. 
> When creating the pipeline infrastructure, you can use the `single-click-cross-account-pipeline.sh` script or else follow the "Walkthrough" section of the [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/aws-building-a-secure-cross-account-continuous-delivery-pipeline/). 
#### Pre-requisites 
1. Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).
2. Intall the [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).
3. Clone this repository.
4. Have the following AWS accounts (if using Control Tower, [this is useful](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/account-factory.html#quick-account-provisioning)):
    * Tooling
    * Development
    * Test
    * Production

#### 1. Create a sample application using Serverless Application Model (SAM). 

We will create a sample serverless application locally, then commit the code to CodeCommit. From there, CodePipeline will build the serverless application, deploy it using CloudFormation to a test account then you will accept/reject the change from the pipeline.  If you accept the review in CodePipeline, the application will be deployed to production using CloudFormation. 

##### Create the sample application locally

From your terminal application/command line, execute the following command:

```console
sam init 
# Use the values: 
# - Template source:  Quick Start template
# - Runtime: Python 3.7
# - Project Name: sample-lambda
```

This creates a directory named `sample-lambda` in your current directory, which contains the code for a serverless application.

Navigate to the project folder and initialize the git client
```console
cd sample-lambda/
git init
```

#### 2. Create [AWS CodeCommit](code-commit-url) repository in Development Account
##### Console Method
Follow the [instructions here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#getting-started-create-repo) to create a CodeCommit repository in the Development Account. Name your repository as sample-lambda.

##### Terminal Method
From your terminal application, execute the following command. You may refer [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-create-repository.html#how-to-create-repository-cli) for further details on installing the AWS CLI if needed.

```console
aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name sample-lambda --repository-description "Sample Serverless App" --profile {{DEV-ACCOUNT-PROFILE}}
```

Note the cloneUrlHttp URL in the response from above CLI.

#### 3. Add a new remote

From your terminal application, execute the following command:

```console
git remote add AWSCodeCommit {{HTTP_CLONE_URL_FROM_STEP_2}}
```

Follow the instructions [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up.html) for local git setup required to push code to CodeCommit repository.

> Tip: The AWS CodeCommit Helper is useful to obtain Codecommit credentials using a profile, for example: 
>```console
>git config --global credential.helper '!aws --profile {{YOUR-PROFILE-HERE}} codecommit credential-helper $@'
>```

#### 4. Push the code AWS CodeCommit

From your terminal application, execute the following command:

```console
git add .
git commit -m "First push of my SAM app!"
git push AWSCodeCommit master
```

#### 5. See the pipeline in action.
Once you have your pipeline configured [as per the blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/aws-building-a-secure-cross-account-continuous-delivery-pipeline/) across your tools, development, test and production AWS accounts, codepipeline will listen for new deployments to your 'sample-lambda' repository. You can configure the pipeline by following the walkthrough in the blog post or by running the `single-click-cross-account-pipeline.sh` script in this repo. Once it's spun up, push a change to the CodeCommit repo you just made then log in to your tools AWS account to ensure your codepipeline execution has kicked off. 

#### Next Steps
* If you want to deploy a different type of application, you will need to edit the buildspec file defined in the [`code-pipeline.yaml`](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-refarch-cross-account-pipeline/blob/master/ToolsAcct/code-pipeline.yaml) file.
    * You will also need to change the permissions of the roles deployed to the test/dev accounts depending on what type of resources you are deploying. This is in the [`toolsacct-codepipeline-cloudformation-deployer.yaml`](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-refarch-cross-account-pipeline/blob/master/TestAccount/toolsacct-codepipeline-cloudformation-deployer.yaml#L74) file which gets deployed to the Test & Prod accounts in step 3 of the [blog instructions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/aws-building-a-secure-cross-account-continuous-delivery-pipeline/).


1 - In the Tools account, deploy this CloudFormation template. It will create the customer master keys (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), 
    grant access to Dev, Test, Prod and Prod2 accounts to use these keys, and create an Amazon S3 bucket to hold artifacts from AWS CodePipeline.

cd /Users/salvales/Project/Pipeline/aws-refarch-cross-account-pipeline
aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name pre-reqs \
--template-file ToolsAcct/pre-reqs.yaml --parameter-overrides \
DevAccount=231312449617 TestAccount=574029865612 \
ProductionAccount=014866128417 ProductionAccount2=006169631543 \
--profile Pipeline-Tools


2 - In the Dev account, which hosts the AWS CodeCommit repository, deploy this CloudFormation template. This template will create the IAM roles, 
    which will later be assumed by the pipeline running in the Tools account. Enter the AWS account number for the Tools account and the CMK ARN.

aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name toolsacct-codepipeline-role \
--template-file DevAccount/toolsacct-codepipeline-codecommit.yaml \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
--parameter-overrides ToolsAccount=281347101436 CMKARN=arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:281347101436:key/8dbb8c2d-e2d2-4dcf-8a03-c241bd4f8731 \
--profile Pipeline-Dev


3 - In the Test and Prods accounts where you will deploy the Lambda code, execute this CloudFormation template. 
    This template creates IAM roles, which will later be assumed by the pipeline to create, deploy, and update the sample AWS Lambda function through CloudFormation.

aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name toolsacct-codepipeline-cloudformation-role \
--template-file TestAccount/toolsacct-codepipeline-cloudformation-deployer.yaml \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
--parameter-overrides ToolsAccount=281347101436 CMKARN=arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:281347101436:key/8dbb8c2d-e2d2-4dcf-8a03-c241bd4f8731 \
S3Bucket=pre-reqs-artifactbucket-wpjuv2hddvni \
--profile Pipeline-Test

aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name toolsacct-codepipeline-cloudformation-role \
--template-file TestAccount/toolsacct-codepipeline-cloudformation-deployer.yaml \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
--parameter-overrides ToolsAccount=281347101436 CMKARN=arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:281347101436:key/8dbb8c2d-e2d2-4dcf-8a03-c241bd4f8731 \
S3Bucket=pre-reqs-artifactbucket-wpjuv2hddvni \
--profile Pipeline-Prod

aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name toolsacct-codepipeline-cloudformation-role \
--template-file TestAccount/toolsacct-codepipeline-cloudformation-deployer.yaml \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
--parameter-overrides ToolsAccount=281347101436 CMKARN=arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:281347101436:key/8dbb8c2d-e2d2-4dcf-8a03-c241bd4f8731 \
S3Bucket=pre-reqs-artifactbucket-wpjuv2hddvni \
--profile Pipeline-Prod2


4 - In the Tools account, which hosts AWS CodePipeline, execute this CloudFormation template. 
    This creates a pipeline, but does not add permissions for the cross accounts (Dev, Test, Prod and Prod2).

aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name sample-lambda-pipeline \
--template-file ToolsAcct/code-pipeline.yaml \
--parameter-overrides DevAccount=231312449617 TestAccount=574029865612 \
ProductionAccount=014866128417 ProductionAccount2=006169631543 CMKARN=arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:281347101436:key/8dbb8c2d-e2d2-4dcf-8a03-c241bd4f8731 \
S3Bucket=pre-reqs-artifactbucket-wpjuv2hddvni --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
--profile Pipeline-Tools


5 - In the Tools account, execute this CloudFormation template, which give access to the role created in step 4. 
    This role will be assumed by AWS CodeBuild to decrypt artifacts in the S3 bucket. This is the same template that was used in step 1, but with different parameters.

aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name pre-reqs \
--template-file ToolsAcct/pre-reqs.yaml \
--parameter-overrides CodeBuildCondition=true \
--profile Pipeline-Tools

6 - In the Tools account, execute this CloudFormation template, which will do the following:
    Add the IAM role created in step 2. This role is used by AWS CodePipeline in the Tools account for checking out code from the AWS CodeCommit repository in the Dev account.
    Add the IAM role created in step 3. This role is used by AWS CodePipeline in the Tools account for deploying the code package to the Test and Prods accounts.

aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name sample-lambda-pipeline \
--template-file ToolsAcct/code-pipeline.yaml \
--parameter-overrides CrossAccountCondition=true \
--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
--profile Pipeline-Tools
